# Sudoku-Challenge
Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits such that each column, each row and each 3x3 sub-grid contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. The challenge this week is to write code capable of validating whether a given Sudoku solution is valid or not.
    
# Rewards:
:five:  Points are awarded for an algorithm capable of validating these sample games.

:three:  Further points are awarded for solving the challenge in a unique choice of language among other participants

:two:  Further points are awarded for outputting a description of where an error in a game lies (for example Row 2, or Sub-grid 1,2 etc).


# Example:
 ```[
  [1, 5, 2, 4, 8, 9, 3, 7, 6],
  [7, 3, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8, 4, 1],
  [4, 6, 8, 3, 7, 1, 2, 9, 5],
  [3, 8, 7, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 9],
  [5, 9, 1, 7, 6, 3, 4, 2, 8],
  [2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 5, 7, 1, 3],
  [9, 1, 4, 6, 3, 7, 5, 8, 2],
  [6, 2, 5, 9, 4, 8, 1, 3, 7],
  [8, 7, 3, 5, 1, 2, 9, 6, 4]
